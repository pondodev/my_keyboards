# my keyboards

welcome! this is a repo to track what keyboards i have, what keyboards i want to build, and also my plans for designs i
wish to create. this is all very free form and really just a way to keep an inventory of what it is i'm doing keyboard
wise. feel free to use this as a way to make fun of how many keyboards i have, i think it's ridiculous too.
